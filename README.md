# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
After you’ve completed the technical analysis for each deliverable, provide a short summary of the results in the README.md of the analysis. For the final deliverable, you’ll write up a short description of the study design for additional statistical analysis. In the written summaries, we would like you to think critically about your analysis, not demonstrate mastery of automotive manufacturing.
